Calorimetry is the science of measuring the amount of heat released or absorbed during a chemical reaction. The bomb calorimeter is a laboratory device used to determine the calorific value of a fuel or substance by measuring the heat of combustion at constant volume. It operates based on the First Law of Thermodynamics, which states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed. In this experiment, a known mass of the fuel is burned in a sealed, high-pressure steel container called the bomb, which is filled with pure oxygen to ensure complete combustion. The bomb is submerged in a known quantity of water inside a calorimeter. The heat released during combustion increases the temperature of the water and the calorimeter body. This temperature rise is measured and used to calculate the energy content of the fuel.

Principle of Bomb Calorimeter:
The bomb calorimeter operates on the principle of constant-volume calorimetry, where the heat released by the combustion of a sample is absorbed by the surrounding water and the calorimeter itself. The temperature rise is then used to calculate the energy content of the sample.

A typical bomb calorimeter consists of

Combustion Chamber (Bomb): A strong steel container that holds the sample and oxygen.

Sample Cup: Contains the fuel sample to be combusted.

Oxygen Supply: Pure oxygen is introduced to ensure complete combustion.

Ignition System: An electric ignition coil initiates the combustion.

Water Jacket: Surrounds the bomb to absorb the heat released.

Thermometer: Measures the temperature change of the water.

Stirrer: Ensures uniform temperature distribution in the water.

Working Procedure:-

A known mass of the fuel sample is placed in the sample cup.

The bomb is filled with pure oxygen and sealed.

The bomb is placed in the water jacket.

The initial temperature of the water is recorded.

The sample is ignited electrically.

The final temperature of the water is recorded after combustion.

The temperature change is used to calculate the heat released.

📐 Calculations:-
The Gross Calorific Value (GCV) is calculated using the formula:

GCV

GCV=

(W+w)×ΔT−C 
f

Where:


W = Mass of water (g)


w = Water equivalent of the calorimeter (g)


ΔT = Rise in temperature (°C)


C 
f
​
  = Correction factor for fuse wire and acid formation (J)

m = Mass of the fuel sample (g)

This formula accounts for the total heat absorbed by the water and the calorimeter, subtracting any corrections, and divides by the mass of the sample to find the energy content per gram.
