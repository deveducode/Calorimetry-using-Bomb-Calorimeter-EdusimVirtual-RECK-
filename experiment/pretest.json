      "question": " Why is the bomb calorimeter referred to as a constant volume calorimeter?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Because the pressure inside remains constant",
        "b": " Because the outer container doesnâ€™t expand",
        "c": "Because the combustion chamber is rigid and sealed",
        "d": "Because the volume of water used remains the same"
