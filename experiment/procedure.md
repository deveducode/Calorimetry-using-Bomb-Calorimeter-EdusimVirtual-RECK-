Preparation of the Sample:

Accurately weigh a known mass (typically 1g) of the substance to be tested (e.g., benzoic acid or other combustible sample).

Place the sample into the crucible of the bomb calorimeter.

Setting up the Bomb Calorimeter:

Assemble the bomb by attaching the ignition wires and ensuring they touch the sample.

Add a known volume of oxygen (typically 25 atm) into the bomb to support combustion.

Place the bomb into the calorimeter vessel filled with a known volume of water (usually around 2000 mL).

Initial Temperature Recording:

Record the initial temperature of the water using a thermometer or temperature sensor connected to the virtual interface.

Ignition:

Initiate the combustion of the sample by triggering the ignition system in the virtual lab.

The sample burns, and the heat released is absorbed by the surrounding water.

Monitoring Temperature Change:

Continuously monitor and record the temperature until it reaches a maximum and starts to stabilize.

Note the highest temperature reached.

Calculation of Heat Released:

Use the temperature change (ΔT), the known heat capacity of the calorimeter system (including the water and bomb), 
and the formula
q=C×ΔT

where 

q is the heat released and 

C is the heat capacity of the system.

If needed, calculate the heat of combustion per gram or per mole of the substance.

Result Analysis:

Compare the calculated value with theoretical or known standard values.

Repeat the experiment for accuracy, if required by the simulation.
