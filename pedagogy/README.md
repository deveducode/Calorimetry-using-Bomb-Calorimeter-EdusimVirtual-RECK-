#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  : Inquiry-Based Learning With Simulation 
###### Assessment Method:  Learners will be assessed through a combination of formative quizzes during the simulation and a summative test at the end, including theoretical and numerical questions. They will perform calculations of heat of combustion based on experimental data and analyze temperature-time graphs. Additionally, students will submit a short reflection on their learning experience and identify possible sources of error. This approach ensures understanding, application, and critical thinking. 

<u> <b>Description: </b>Students will explore the calorimetry concept through interactive simulations. The module allows them to change parameters (sample mass, type, initial conditions), observe real-time data (temperature vs. time graphs), and calculate heat of combustion. Learners will be encouraged to hypothesize, run simulations, observe outcomes, and draw conclusions based on experimental data.    </u>
